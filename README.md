## Stylebot Styles for dev

Little repo of useful CSS to improve daily dev workflow.

Requires [Stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha?hl=en-GB) to be installed on your browser, or an alternative CSS style extension.

### Currently has the following sites setup:

1. GitHub - Shows the "convert to draft" button as an actual styled button
2. Semaphore - Show pipelines vertically instead of a long horizontal scroll.
